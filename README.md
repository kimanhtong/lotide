# Lotide Project

The Lotide project is a modular collection of functions that operate on data, namely Arrays and Objects.
The project was published on `npmjs.com`.

## Final Product
The project provides 17 functions with main purposes as following:
1. assertObjectsEqual: a function that takes in 2 objects and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
2. assertArraysEqual: a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
3. assertEqual: a function that takes in 2 values and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
4. countLetters: a function that takes in a sentence and returns a count of each of the letters in the sentence.
5. findKey: a function that takes in an object and callback, then returns the first key that meets the criteria specified in callback.
6. map: a function that takes in an array and a callback and returns a new array based on the results of the callback on each item in the array.
7. takeUntil: a function that takes in an array and callback and returns a slice of the array based on the criteria specified in the callback.
8. without: a function that takes in a source array and an itemsToRemove arrays and returns only the items from the source array that are not in the itemsToRemove array.
9. countOnly: a function that takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items.
10. eqArrays: a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if the arrays are equal and false otherwise.
11. eqObjects: a function that takes in 2 objects and return true if they are equal and false otherwise.
12. findKeyByValue: a function that takes in an object and a value and returns the first key that corresponds to that value.
13. flatten: a function that takes in an array that contains elements including nested array of elements and returns a flattened version of the array.
14. head: a function that takes in an array and returns the first element in the array.
15. letterPositions: a function that takes in a string and returns all indices of letter positions in the string.
16. middle: a function that takes in an array and returns middle most element of the array.
17. tail: a function that takes in an array and returns everything except the first element of the array.
